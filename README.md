## Rationale Behind Dataset Selection

**Heart disease** is a significant cause of mortality globally, and the dataset, sourced from the [**2022 annual CDC survey**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease) of **400k+ adults**, provides invaluable insights into various factors contributing to heart disease prevalence. Our intention with utilizing this dataset is to develop a predictive model that can aid in identifying individuals at risk of heart disease. This is particularly significant in regions like Colombia, where sufficient data and datasets regarding cardiovascular diseases may be lacking. In [Colombia, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4705360/), with a significant number of these events being preventable. Given the similarity in risk factors and health patterns, using the CDC dataset on key indicators of heart disease in American adults could provide valuable **insights** to inform preventive and public health strategies in Colombia. By comparing and contrasting demographic and health data between both populations, the research and recommendations could be more effectively tailored, addressing the specific needs and characteristics of the Colombian population. Furthermore, the dataset's richness is evident in its offering of **40 variables** for observation, coupled with over **400k+ samples**.



## Our Hypothesis
Based on key indicators of heart disease, we could assert that there is a significant relationship between the prevalence of heart disease and factors such as physical health days, sex, mental health days, sleep hours, history of heart attacks, body mass index (BMI), and pre-existing conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking habits, and diabetes in the adult population surveyed in the BRFSS dataset.
